# JavaScript-Calculator

How to run the application:
There is no .exe file for this program.  To run the calculator application, you can follow this

Please note: 
This application implements a string tokenizing algorithm, along with a shunting yard
algorithm.  I did not invent these algorithms on my own, I found these algorithms while doing
research on calculator logic, and modified/implemented them for use in this particular program.

A note on using parenthesis: 
You must include an operator before an opening parenthesis or you will
encounter an error.  For example, you cannot enter 1(1+1) to get an answer of 2.  Instead, you must
enter 1*(1+1).

A note on operators:
As soon you enter an operator into your expression (+, -, *, /, %, ^), the 
screen will clear itself to make room for the next argument in the expression.  For example, if 
you enter '24 * 3', '24' will be displayed on the screen until you press '*', at which point the screen
will go blank while it waits for you to enter '3'.  When you press the '3' button, '3' will then be
displayed on the screen.  When you press the '=' the screen will display the solution if you have
entered a valid input, or NaN (not a number) otherwise.
